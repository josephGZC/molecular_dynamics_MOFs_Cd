Investigating the Removal of Cadmium from Water through UiO-66 Derivatives using Molecular Dynamics

The contamination of cadmium in water sources continues to be a global health and environmental concern. Exposure to this element is associated with a myriad of diseases such as breast and lung cancer, bronchiolitis, emphysema, and cerebral infection. It also harms aquatic organisms by decreasing reproduction, growth, and endocrine system development. Given the dangers correlated with Cd(II), it has been placed seventh on the priority list of toxic substances.

Initiatives geared toward the removal of Cd(II) include absorption, ion exchange, electrodeposition, membrane filtration, and chemical precipitation \cite{qasem2021removal}. Adsorption is the most promising given its low cost, mild operating conditions, strong applicability, and high removal rate \cite{qasem2021removal,idris2023introduction}. Some adsorption methods that have been extensively studied are silica-based materials, clays, and resin, but these materials lack functional tunability and recyclability \cite{wu2019efficient,idris2023introduction}. This necessitates further development of effective adsorbents. 


Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of porous materials constructed from various metallic nodes and organic linkers through coordination bonds have recently attracted much attention due to their exceptional properties. Their high porosity, ultrahigh surface area, diverse structures, and customizable surface functionalities have led to their applications in catalysis, sensors, gas storage, and selective separation \cite{ahmed2019gd3+,freund2021current}. These traits are also especially beneficial as versatile adsorbents, leading to the potential of MOFs for water purification purposes. A limitation in the majority of MOFs is their unstable nature in water, which is caused by the ability of water to displace bound ligands as it competitively interacts with the metal nodes.

Among the MOFs with exceptional stability in an aqueous environment is UiO-66 (Zr$_6$O$_4$ (OH)$_4$(CO$_2$)$_{12}$) \cite{winarta2019decade}. It is made of Zr$_6$O$_4$(OH)$_4$ metal clusters that are 12-fold connected by 1,4-benzedicarboxylic (BDC) acid linkers as shown in Figure \ref{uio66_unit-cell} \cite{winarta2019decade}. This is isopointal to a face-centered-cubic structure, giving rise to one of the most stable MOFs \cite{ahmadijokani2020superior}. Pristine UiO-66 was found to adsorb various heavy metals but adsorption uptake was among the lowest compared to other MOFs \cite{wu2019efficient}. By shifting to functional derivatives of UiO-66, adsorption capability has become exceptionally high \cite{ahmadijokani2020superior}. Such derivatives are frequently developed through the attachment of functional groups onto the BDC linkers. For instance, UiO-66-NH$_{2}$ has an amino (-NH$_{2}$) group in place of a hydrogen atom in the benzene ring of BDC. This UiO-66 analog was found to have five times more adsorption capacity for Pb(II) compared to UiO-66 \cite{yin2016rapid}. When applied to Cd(II), the same amino-functionalized UiO-66 achieved 60\% higher adsorption uptake \cite{laptenkova2019post,wang2017efficient}.
The increased adsorption was attributed to the lone pair electrons of amino groups. This increases the local electron density of adsorption sites, which attracts excess anions from the solution \cite{chang2019adsorption,wang2017efficient}. 


Other functional groups with lone pair electrons are hydroxyl and carboxylic groups. However, these have not yet been applied with Zr-based MOFs in the study of cadmium uptake. In this study, UiO-66 derivatives, such as UiO-66-OH and UiO-66-COOH, were studied for their viability in the adsorption of cadmium in an aqueous environment using molecular dynamics simulations.


\section{General and Specific Aims}
The general objective of this study is to investigate the viability of UiO-66 derivatives, such as UiO-66-(OH) and UiO-66-(COOH), for the removal of Cd(II) from water. 

Specifically, this research work seeks to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item compute the cadmium percent removal of  UiO-66-(OH) and UiO-66-(COOH) in water using molecular dynamics simulations, 
    \item construct potentially more effective UiO-66 functional derivatives based on the better-performing MOF, and
    \item  describe the adsorption behavior of cadmium towards the investigated MOFs using distribution profiles, mobility analysis, radial distribution functions, and adsorption energy.  
\end{enumerate}

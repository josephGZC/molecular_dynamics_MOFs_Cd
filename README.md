Investigating the Removal of Cadmium from Water through UiO-66 Derivatives using Molecular Dynamics

Cadmium contamination in water sources poses significant health and environmental risks, being linked to diseases like breast and lung cancer, bronchiolitis, and cerebral infection. Considering this, constant investigation on Cd(II) removal is essential.  Among water purification techniques, adsorption is most promising due to its cost-effectiveness, mild operating conditions, and high efficiency. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising adsorbent, offering high porosity, ultrahigh surface area, and customizable functionalities, making them ideal for water purification.

UiO-66, a Zr-based MOF with exceptional aqueous stability, has demonstrated significant potential in water treatment. Composed of Zr<sub>6</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub> metal clusters connected by 1,4-benzedicarboxylic acid (BDC) linkers, UiO-66 exhibits a robust structure ideal for heavy metal adsorption. Functional derivatives of UiO-66, such as UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>, have shown remarkable improvements in adsorption capacity, attributed to enhanced local electron density from functional groups like amino groups. Despite this progress, derivatives featuring hydroxyl and carboxylic groups remain underexplored for cadmium uptake. This study aims to address this gap by evaluating the cadmium adsorption performance of UiO-66-(OH) and UiO-66-(COOH) derivatives using molecular dynamics simulations. The research further seeks to analyze their adsorption mechanisms through distribution profiles, mobility analysis, radial distribution functions, and adsorption energy, providing insights into their viability for water purification applications.
